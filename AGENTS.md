# Dotfiles project instructions

## Scope and sources

This file governs work in this project. `home/.codex/AGENTS.md` is the separate, portable device-wide instruction file; do not install this project-specific file as global guidance.

- Read `README.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, and the relevant decisions before changing the baseline. The baseline passed isolated Linux and disposable native macOS validation. The user has authorized reviewed public repository creation and current Mac activation; keep future targets and changes within their own task authorization.
- Shared candidate files live in `home/`, optional machine integrations in `machines/`, native package manifests in `packages/`, and isolated checks in `tests/container/`.
- Agents may parallelize independent work. Give each agent clear ownership, integrate its findings, and close it when done. Avoid conflicting edits.
- Every project must have an append-only `decisions.jsonl` for consequential decisions. Every activity requiring multiple CLI commands must have an existing or newly created runbook; keep it current.

## Baseline and privacy

- Preserve the approved baseline in `decisions.jsonl`. Record consequential decisions and update `RUNBOOK.md` for multi-command operations.
- Use `ACTIVATION.md` before a device rollout and `PUBLIC-CONTENTS.md` before publication review. Keep installation separate from upgrades; use the documented no-upgrade setup command. Follow `SKILL-SOURCES.md` for reviewed source revisions rather than silently refreshing skill snapshots.
- Use plain files, native package managers, and explicit commands. Do not introduce Paw, Ansible, a plugin manager, a sync daemon, or a custom configuration parser.
- Do not use Python for agent-authored scripts, automation, data processing, or validation commands. Use shell, Bun/TypeScript, or Go instead. Python use requires an explicit user exception. Existing Python-dependent tools are not authorization to use Python for new work; flag their dependencies and preserve approved behavior when planning a replacement.
- `jq`, Bun, and Go are required on every managed machine. Preserve approved aliases, Zoxide navigation, Atuin search, Bun/fnm, direnv, shell plugin features, and appearance.
- Keep shared configuration separate from non-secret machine differences and private/generated state. Never bulk-copy a home or `.config` directory.
- Do not read, print, copy, or publish credentials, private keys, real histories, environment databases, or private project configuration. Use synthetic fixtures for tests.
- No download, install, synchronization, or update command belongs in shell startup. Native shell caches/history may be written during normal interactive use.
- Do not initialize, stage, commit, configure a remote, push, or create a GitHub repository until the user authorizes the exact reviewed public contents. Treat existing `.git` metadata as unreviewed.
- Local preparation and disposable container tests are authorized. Host installation, live file relinking, service removal, remote changes, and scheduling require separate task authorization.
- Container checks never mount the host home or Docker socket. Run tests disconnected, non-root, without capabilities, and remove test containers after exit.
- Linux validation does not establish macOS GUI behavior or real connectivity. Report test success, activation, publication, and machine acceptance separately.
- Later fleet maintenance may use SSH over existing Tailscale, skip unreachable machines, and keep private values outside the public project. Do not schedule it now or redesign homelab backups.

## Validation and delivery

- For shell, plugin, or package changes, follow the Docker build/run commands in `README.md` and the container section of `RUNBOOK.md`. Do not rerun the container suite for documentation-only edits.
- Parse changed Zsh files before executing them. Use synthetic fixtures for behavior tests and validate the native Brewfile syntax separately.
- Preserve Starship and Ghostty appearance unless the user requests a change. Validate Ghostty with the installed native validator when its configuration changes.
- Review the exact public file allowlist in `README.md`; never stage the entire workspace. `work/` and `outputs/` are local artifacts, and existing `.git` history remains unreviewed.
- Report changed files, verified behavior, unresolved device-specific checks, and whether anything was activated or published. Keep hostnames, addresses, identity, and secrets out of public reports and logs.
